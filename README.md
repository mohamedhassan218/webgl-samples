# WebGL Samples

This repository contains the code samples implemented during the computer graphics course based on the [WebGL Programming Guide](https://sites.google.com/site/webglbook/) book.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Just a browser due to our samples based on JavaScript.

## Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:mohamedhassan218/webgl-samples.git 
    ```
2. Open the `.html` file in any folder for any sample to see the output in your browser. Each sample is organized into its own directory and can be run independently.
